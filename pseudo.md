# Productivity Task Manager Pseudo 

New Task: 
* At the start of the program ask for (E) edit mode, (V) view mode. So that you can edit or view your progress on each project 
* Create a for loop in which each instance is datalist is viewed or edited 
* Find a way to add a new struct type 
* Also there should be a way to view all values for each struct, so like a loop for each struct type value, without having to call each struct name 
* Maybe find a way to ask the user to each a data structure within a data structure so then, each task for the project can be tracked. 
* Also maybe for each project add a struct value, called completed and it can either say true or false if the project is 100 percent complete. 

Next Task: 
* Create a CLI program that communicates to the user
* One add-on we can add is to update the progress bar/number and update it
 

Goals for the project 
* Create a task manager that tracks team members projects, and progress
* admin/manager will access the data through the app and check in on real-time progress 
* Each team member can update their progress on the project
* Try and find a way to add a pseudo-code feature and then have a log in which you can track your progress for each instance. 
* The goal is to make a cool productivity CLI project, or maybe a GUI project using Go
* If you go with the GUI idea, try looking at the fyne framework
